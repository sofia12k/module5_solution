  <h1>About This Website</h1>
  <p>
    It may be hard to tell, but this website does much more than just help you choose a delicious dish from this cozy little restaurant. The website of this restaurant has served over <strong>100,000 students all over the world</strong> (and counting), teaching them the skills of how to develop a website from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The development of this website was part of the curriculum of two Coursera.org courses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All courses have an option to be taken for free.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of November, 2016, both courses made it to the #1 Top Rated Course spot (among close to 1,800 available courses).
  </p>
  <p>
    To give you a little preview, here is a video from one of the courses:

    The courses and this site were not a labor of just one person. We owe a debt of gratitude to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Moshe Chaikin of <a href="https://www.storywithlight.com" target="_blank">StoryWithLight.com</a>, who not only filmed and produced the Field Trip video (featured above), but also provided food photography so the users of the site can see a picture of each dish.</li>
    <li>Kalman Hazins, who coded the backend service for this website.</li>
    <li>Finally, the owners of David Chu's China Bistro restaurant who graciously agreed to assist us in this project.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The final implementation of this site is done in AngularJS. If you would like to see the version of this site without the Angular framework, <a href="#">click here</a>.
